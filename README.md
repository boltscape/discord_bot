Server Bot for FreeMC Host

This bot will help you manage your FreeMC Host server.

Setting up the bot

You will need to change 4 things in the code to set up the bot for your needs:
1. Your Discord bot token.
2. Your server ID (Can be found in panel under My Servers)
3. Your Account API Key (Again, found in the panel under Account API)
4. You server address (Found on the FreeMC main site, not the panel, under My Servers)

Copy and paste these 4 things at the relevant locations in the code and run it locally/find a place to host your bot.
