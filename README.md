Server Bot for Pterodactyl based hosts

This bot will help you manage your Pterodactyl host servers.

Setting up the bot

You will need to add 4 things to set up the bot for your needs:
1. Your Discord bot token.
2. Your server ID (Can be found in panel under My Servers)
3. Your Account API Key (Again, found in the panel under Account API)
4. You server address (Also found the panel, under My Servers)

Add the Discord bot and Account API keys to environment variables and also add in your server ID and address at the designated places in the code,
and you're gucci. Find a place to host or host it yourself.
